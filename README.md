# Miconia-BioEcon--Model

### R and Rstudio are required to run this model. All package dependencies are annotated in the markdown file.

The Lewis_R0_data.csv is an example of generated dispersal distances for miconia based on its dispersal kernal (probability density function of dipsersal distance from maternal source).

The model is setup to knit together and produce markdown files on each run and export plots and .xls files for model outputs.

### Running the Model

1. Downloand Lewis_R0_data.csv or have a .csv file with a single column of distances to be used.
2. Download
